### Week in Review:

This week went alright in terms of getting stuff done. Got most things done that I needed. Wasn't very good at shutting down all screens and reading after 10. I need to read more, so much I want to read. Actually worked out 5 planned days last week which is awesome. Need to continue doing so. Found a budgetting app that hopefully helps cut down on wasteful spending, especially on food. What gets tracked gets improved.
