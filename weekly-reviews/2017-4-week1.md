### Weekly Review

This week was aight. Started a new workout routine. A hybrid program between olympic crossfit lifting and a bodybuilding split. I finally paid my state taxes. All $12 dollars. I kept track of my macros; as always I've been overestimating how much I actually eat. Need to stuff my face to be gaining weight. I didn't manage to take any profile pics. But I did get started on the side project. Built a login/user management system so far. This upcoming week, I hope to get the rest of the 'basics' done.
