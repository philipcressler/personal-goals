### Review:
Was miserably sick all week so wasn't very productive. Didn't do anything that I meant to do besides a mealplan...This will will have to make up for the past week. I did meet up with my good friend Peter and had a good discussion. Made me realize that I need to put more 'skin in the game'. I'm thinking that next month, I need to do one of my monthly challenges. Which one tho?
