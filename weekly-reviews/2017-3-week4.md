### Week in Review

This week went aight. Came up with a side project that I will pursue. Solves a problem for my girlfriend and hopefully enough other people to be profitable. Worst case, it'll be a good learning opportunity. I didn't get around to building a subscribe page for my blog. Not sure what service to use to send the emails. Mailchimp autoresponder is a paid feature it looks like. Possibly mailgun? Need to do more research. Also starting to get back into fitness. New routine (a crossfit/powerlifting hybrid) and downloaded a food tracking app to help count calories.
